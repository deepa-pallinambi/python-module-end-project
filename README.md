data analysis is performed on a data set named "employees",which is in the csv format.for this various libraries numpy(for numerical calculations),pandas(used with data set),matplotlib(used for dta visualization),seaborn(used for data visualization with advanced features) are used.this data set contains 458 rows and 9 coloumns.pre processing of data is done at first to identify the columns\indices,to understand whether there is null value or duplicated value.height coloumn has incorrect data that has to be modified.after that various kind of data analysis is performed including the graphical representation of age and salary of employees using scatter plot.numpy is imported as np,pandas as pd,mathplotlib pyplot as plt and seaborn as sns.data set is imported in csv format with the help of pandas.various kind of data analysis is performed using these libraries such as counting values of a specific column,sorting values,grouping columns with respect to some crieterias , comparing reklationship between various columns,analysing stastistical measure of different coulumn,using graphical repesentation for the easy understanding of data,etc.here correlation btw two data is performed and for that scatter plot is used.
